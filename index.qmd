## Booking page

Please email with me with the times that you can make; I will then
find a convenient slot.  By default, I can send a Zoom link, but if
you are in Cambridge let me know if you would like to meet in the Math
dept.


```{r,echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
dat <- readLines("/tmp/officehrs.dat")
df <- data.frame(Time=dat)
kable(df)
```


<!-- 

Would be nice to automate this somehow so if the org file is changed, 
then the html is automatically updated.
